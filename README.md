# Optio protocol

Optio protocol is a decentralized capital efficient options protocol that
enables writers and buyers to create and manage options.

### Developers

Optio protocol enables any developer to create semi-fungible tokens with
arbitrary data structures, that represent rights and obligations, with fully
on-chain metadata storage. On-chain metadata on StarkNet opens up new use cases
that were prohibitively expensive or too computationally intensive.

### End-users

Optio protocol enables any user to create arbitrary options tokens, that
represent rights and obligations. The tokens created by Optio are European
options style, meaning all the options will automatically be exercised at
expiry. A holder can redeem the proceeds, the protocol will pay the holder the
value based on strike price and underlying spot price at expiry, instead of
actually exchanging the underlying asset.
